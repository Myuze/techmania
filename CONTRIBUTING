Please read before submitting issues:
* Search the existing issues to make sure no one has submitted your issue already. Duplicate issues will be marked as so.
* For feature requests, please check the [kanban](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/projects/1) first. Do not request features that are planned for future versions, unless you strongly believe they should be implemented earlier or later than planned.
* For bugs:
  * Please check the [release notes](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/releases) to make sure your bug is not among the known issues.
  * Please describe in as much detail as possible the steps to reproduce your issue. Attach screenshots or videos if necessary.
  * If the issue occurs in a specific track, you can attach the "track.tech" file inside the track folder.
  * If the issue involves the game soft locking or freezing, attaching the log file may help, which is located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\DJ Hitori\TECHMANIA\Player.log`. Before attaching, please go through the file and remove personal information you don't want to share, such as directory names and your computer's specs.
