# TECHMANIA
A work-in-progress, open-source clone of a certain dead rhythm game, written in Unity. I believe this is legal; but I will do whatever I can to avoid any legal issues just in case, including not mentioning the name of the original game I'm cloning.

## Roadmap and Progress
Head to the [Project](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/projects/1) tab for more detailed and more up-to-date information. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/releases) to download the released versions.

## How to play
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/wiki/How-to-play).

## Platform
The current target is Windows PCs, with the Touch control scheme requiring a touchscreen monitor. Due to the associated cost, and a lack of hardware, I do not target Android or iOS/iPadOS at the moment.

Note that it is possible to play TECHMANIA on a mobile device. Connect the device to your PC, run the Unity Remote app on your device, open and run the project in Unity, and then Unity will stream game graphics to your device, and receive touch input from it. However the frame rate and lag are quite unbearable.
