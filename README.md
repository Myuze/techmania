# TECHMANIA
A work-in-progress, open-source clone of a certain dead rhythm game, written in Unity. I believe this is legal; but I will do whatever I can to avoid any legal issues just in case, including not mentioning the name of the original game I'm cloning.

Head to [Releases](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/releases) to download the released versions.

## Licensing
All code and assets are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE), with the following exceptions:
* Sound effects in [TECHMANIA/Assets/Sfx](TECHMANIA/Assets/Sfx) are acquired from external resources, which use different licenses. Refer to [TECHMANIA/Assets/Sfx/Attributions.md](TECHMANIA/Assets/Sfx/Attributions.md) for details. Please note that some licenses prohibit commercial use.

## Roadmap and Progress
Refer to the [Kanban](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/projects/1).

## How to play
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/wiki/How-to-play).

## Platform
The current target is Windows PCs, with the Touch control scheme requiring a touchscreen monitor. Patterns using other control schemes are playable with a mouse and keyboard. Due to the associated cost, legal risk, and lack of hardware, I will not target Android or iOS/iPadOS.

The game may be ported to WebGL in the future so it can be played on any web-enabled device. However there are no concrete plans to make such a port at this moment.
