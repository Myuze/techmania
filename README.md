## Roadmap and Progress
Refer to the [Kanban](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/projects/1).

## How to play
The game includes tutorials, but you can also find textual instructions in the [Wiki](https://github.com/macmillan333/techmania/wiki/How-to-play).

## Platform
The current target is Windows PCs, with the Touch control scheme requiring a touchscreen monitor. Patterns using other control schemes are playable with a mouse and keyboard. Due to the associated cost and lack of hardware, I will not target Android or iOS/iPadOS.

The game may be ported to WebGL in the future so it can be played on any web-enabled device. However there are no concrete plans to make such a port at this moment.
