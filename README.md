# TECHMANIA
An attempt at an open-source clone of a certain dead rhythm game. I believe this is legal; but I will do whatever I can to avoid any legal issues just in case, including not mentioning the name of the original game I'm cloning.

## What I aim to eventually accomplish

TECHMANIA will be a touchscreen-based rhythm game. Stationary notes appear in 1 of 4 lanes, and a few scanlines scan back and forth across the screen. Touch the notes when a scanline passes their center.

Due to the associated cost, and a lack of hardware, I will not target Android or iOS/iPadOS at this moment. The current target is touchscreen-enabled Windows PCs, including but not limited to Surfaces and Surface Studios. If you have a regular PC, you can add a touchscreen to it by:

* Connecting a touchscreen monitor, or
* Connecting an Android tablet or iPad with Duet Display installed

The game will include a pattern editor, but I do not have any plan to build a platform for pattern distribution at the moment.

## Control schemes

A touchscreen is not strictly required because the game will support 3 control schemes.

* Touchscreen: touch the notes
* Keyboard/gamepad: each lane is associated with a row of keys or specific buttons on a gamepad, press keys/buttons to hit notes
* Keyboard + mouse: click some kinds of notes with the mouse cursor, press any key for other kinds of notes
