[Fantom Plugin](TECHMANIA/Assets/FantomPlugin) is acquired from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/android-native-dialogs-and-functions-plugin-106497). This library is not available open source, however the author states the following on their [website](http://fantom1x.blog130.fc2.com/):

"コードやアセットなどの使用はご自由に。著作者明記、使用報告・許諾なども不要。特に利用制限はありません。"

Based on this statement we conclude that our usage of this library is warrented. However, in conformance with the [Standard Unity Asset Store EULA](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms), each developer of TECHMANIA should obtain a license of the plugin from the Unity Asset Store.
